# Relaxed Embedded Wasserstein

This repository contains the code for the paper 'Joint Metric Space Embedding of Heterogeneous Data with Optimal Transport'. 
A preprint version is available on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07510).

## Requirements
The simulations have been performed with Python 3.12.2. See the requirements.txt for our libraries. For the experiments in our paper, we additionally used these well-kept repositories:

* [JointMDS](https://github.com/borgwardtlab/jointmds>)
* [UnionCom](https://github.com/caokai1073/UnionCom)
* [SCOT](https://github.com/rsinghlab/SCOT)

Please cite the paper if you use the code.
